FINAL ANALYSIS OF TUMOR TREATMENTS FOR MICE
------------------------------------------------

1. Based on the results from the box and whisker plot, the most succesful drugs when it came to reducing tumor sizes were Capomulin and Ramicane. More testing would be necessary but tumors in mice would best be treated by these two drugs.

2. The linegraph shows that Capomulin is an effective drug that helps to reduce tumor sizes. 

3. Based on the scatter plot and the correlation value of 0.84, there is a strong correlation between a mouse's weight and the tumor size. To decrease the mouse's tumor, it would be best to reduce the mouse's weight through diet and exercise.
